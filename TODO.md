# MAVometer To-Do-List

* pymavlink/tools/mavsummarize.py does part of what I want. Eventually
  want to review mavsummarize.py to cherry-pick more good ideas for
  Mavometer features
* Detaching QSocketNotifier appropriately
* MAVLink state object, which has global state
    * and is also a container for individual message-type trackers?
* add time since message last seen column
* right justify numerical columns so bigger numbers are obvious
* Make sorting work
* Add bar widgets or some sort of graphical indicator eye candy
* Figure out how to replay a file with original inter-message intervals
* Figure out how to replay a file as fast as possible but with timestamps
  reflecting the original inter-message intervals
* Starting and restarting
* Config dialog for port
